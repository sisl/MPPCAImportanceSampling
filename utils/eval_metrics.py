    Compute coverage metrics for model failures compared to Monte Carlo (MC) failures.
    Args::
        mc_failures (torch.Tensor): (n1, d) tensor containing features of MC failures.
        model_failures (torch.Tensor): (n2, d) tensor containing features of model failures.
        n_max (int, optional): Maximum number of samples to use. If None, it defaults to 
            the minimum of the number of MC failures and model failures. Defaults to None.
        n_sample (int, optional): Number of samples to draw for computing metrics. Defaults to 100.
        nearest_k (int, optional): Number of nearest neighbors to use in the PRDC computation. Defaults to 5.
        print_results (bool, optional): Whether to print the results. Defaults to True.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the mean and standard deviation of the coverage metric:
            - "coverage_mean" (torch.Tensor): Mean coverage.
            - "coverage_std" (torch.Tensor): Standard deviation of coverage.
